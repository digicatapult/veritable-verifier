## Folder Structure

All the React components / sub-components, in this project are developed using the _folders-as-components_ methodology (this methodology is described in detail here **[NodeJsOrg article](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v7.x/docs/api/modules.html#modules_folders_as_modules)**).

That means that every existing React component here has its own folder with an _index.js_ file and the component itself. This makes importing components more elegant. In addition, certain components are grouped inside folders and sub-folders.
